# Paxton

In the 19th century gardeners began to build large greenhouses or conservatories to provide plants with both heat and light. The largest was Crystal Palace, built in 1851 by Joseph Paxton (1806-1865). (Paxton was one of the great gardeners of the 19th century although he was also an engineer and architect).
